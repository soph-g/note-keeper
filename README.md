# note-keeper

Attempt to tackle the messages app task from Week 7 at Makers Academy.

Stage 1 - uses notes array for storage, notes did not persist between sessions.
Stage 2 - uses local storage for notes storage, so notes persist when the single page app is accessed through one machine.
Stage 3 - intending to introduce a small SQL database.
